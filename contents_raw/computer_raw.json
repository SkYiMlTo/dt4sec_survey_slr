Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.",

Noticeably, cybersecurity is a major concern in CPSs, since attacks may exploit both cyber and physical vulnerabilities and damage significantly physical equipment, compromise operational safety, and impact negatively on product quality and performance. In this context, CPS design should take both security and resilience requirements into account, by identifying the needed measures not only to prevent but also to withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions and attacks.

For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.",

HDTs are applied, for instance, in healthcare to constantly monitor a patient, allowing medical staff to determine the best treatment on the DT. Although the benefits of DT and HDT are manifold, they suffer from cybersecurity risks that have only recently started to be considered. Moreover, the massive usage of HDTs poses serious privacy issues since HDTs leverage personal information that might be sensitive. In this paper, we aim to illustrate the threats affecting DTs.

Human <em>Digital</em> <em>Twins</em> (HDTs) are a particular type of DTs in which the virtual twin models a human being. HDTs are applied, for instance, in healthcare to constantly monitor a patient, allowing medical staff to determine the best treatment on the DT. Although the benefits of DT and HDT are manifold, they suffer from <em>cybersecurity</em> risks that have only recently started to be considered. Moreover, the massive usage of HDTs poses serious privacy issues since HDTs leverage personal information that might be sensitive. In this paper, we aim to illustrate the threats affecting DTs. Then, we focus on specific threats affecting HDTs with a vision towards future research directions.",

Most of the current DTF proposals allow the generation of DTs at a good pace but affect generality, scalability, portability, and completeness. As a consequence, current DTF are mostly domain-specific and hardly span several application domains (e.g., from simple IoT deployments to the modeling of complex critical infrastructures). Furthermore, the generated DTs often requires a high amount of computational resource to run. In this paper, we present LiDiTE, a solution based on a novel reference model for general-purpose DTFs. LiDiTE overcomes the limitations of state-of-the-art tools by supporting the fine-grained development of real-world complexity scenarios. To achieve that, LiDiTE builds on technologies that favor scalability, reuse, and extensibility of scenarios. We show such features by building the DT of real critical infrastructure and evaluating the performance of our DT against those of the real system. Further contributions of this paper include open access to the source code of LiDiTE and the experimental dataset.",

Traditional methods for building virtual machines using web-service and sensor techniques require a lot of system resources and incur high overheads, which make these techniques unsuitable for cyberphysical cloud manufacturing (CPCM) systems. We propose a novel model, which builds digital twins (virtual machines) so that they can be adapted to the CPCM platform. To achieve this goal, we have designed a framework that can incorporate with MTconnect (a manufacturing protocol to retrieve process information from machine tools) to extract data from physical machines. In addition, we have also designed information models to represent the structure and reflect the real-time state of physical machines.",

Recent studies discuss the possibility of using digital twins for intrusion detection in industrial systems.

In order to create a well synchronized digital-twin simulator in manufacturing, information and activities of a physical machine need to be virtualized.

In this paper, a new method of virtualization is proposed to integrate machining data and operations into the digital-twins using Internet scale machine tool communication method. A fully functional digital-twin is implemented in CPMC testbed using MTComm and several manufacturing application scenarios are developed to evaluate the proposed method and system.

The key to study SOTIF is to construct as many hazardous scenarios as possible and accurately assess SOTIF. It is difficult to test many automated driving vehicles in the current research and discover all the unknown triggering events in the intended functionality. As a new simulation method, vehicle digital twins can simulate as many driving scenarios as possible efficiently and at a low cost in a short time. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm to assess SOTIF with unknown hazards based on the vehicle digital twins based on a Bayesian hazard graph with attributes and Noisy-OR structures. This paper uses CARLA to build the vehicle digital twins and testing this algorithm based on these digital twins. After testing, the SOTIF quantitative assessment algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and has good performance.",

                "abstract": "Traditional service registries or catalogs publish and describe individual services of different entities. In this paper, we propose a new approach of service publication and discovery based on the philosophy of \"product catalogs\". In this new approach, entities are equivalent to products in typical products catalogs. We conceptualize an entity registry where each entry constitutes to its collection of remote services. For logical abstraction of entities, we utilize the concept of Digital Twin (DT). To support our objective, we present a reference DT architecture that virtualizes entities, exposes all its functionalities as services, and offers a remote programmable instance to invoke the services directly from application code. To publish and discover DTs, we propose a novel framework, OpenDT. This framework enables entity owners to publish DTs and allow users to discover them for creating mashups and applications using DT services. It also allows developers to create composite DTs that consists of other DTs for large and complex entities. To evaluate OpenDT, we implement a cyber-manufacturing testbed comprising of multiple machining tools and their DTs. Case validations from testbed show excellent efficiency of DT-driven entity publication and discovery.",

Modern smart farms leverage technologies like big data, Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, etc. The use of these technologies has left these smart farms susceptible to cyber-attacks. In order to help secure the smart farm ecosystem in this paper, we develop a smart farming ontology. Our ontology helps represent various physical entities like sensors, workers on the farm, and their interactions with each other. Using the expressive ontology we implement an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) system to dynamically evaluate access control requests. Furthermore, we discuss various use cases to showcase our access control model in various scenarios on a smart farm.",

Using deep learning algorithm for data analysis in the field of medicine can improve the accuracy of disease recognition. The purpose is to realize the intelligent medical service mode of sharing medical resources among many people under the dilemma of limited medical resources. Firstly, the Digital Twins module in the Deep Learning algorithm is used to establish the medical care and disease auxiliary diagnosis model. With the help of the digital visualization model of Internet of Things technology, data is collected at the client and server. Based on the improved Random Forest algorithm, the demand analysis and target function design of the medical and health care system are carried out. Based on data analysis, the medical and health care system is designed using the improved algorithm. The results show that the intelligent medical service platform can collect and analyze the clinical trial data of patients. The accuracy of improved ReliefF &amp; Wrapper Random Forest (RW-RF) for sepsis disease recognition can reach about 98&#x0025;, and the accuracy of algorithm for disease recognition is also more than 80&#x0025;, which can provide better technical support for disease recognition and medical care services. It provides a solution and experimental reference for the practical problem of scarce medical resources.",

                "abstract": "Vehicle platooning is one of the advanced driving applications expected to be supported by the 5G vehicle to everything (V2X) communications. It holds great potentials on improving road efficiency, driving safety and fuel efficiency. Apart from the organization and internal communication of the platoons, real-time prediction of surrounding road users (such as vehicles and cyclists) is another critical issue. While artificial intelligence (AI) is receiving increasing interests on its application to trajectory prediction, there is a potential problem that the pre-trained neural network models may not well fit the current driving environment and needs online fine-tuning to maintain an acceptable high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a digital twin based real-time trajectory prediction scheme for platoons of connected intelligent vehicles. In this scheme the head vehicle of a platoon senses the surrounding vehicles. A LSTM neural network is applied for real-time trajectory prediction with the sensing outcomes. The head vehicle controls the offloading of the trajectory data and maintains a digital twin to optimize the update of LSTM model. In the digital twin a Deep-Q Learning (DQN) algorithm is utilized for adaptive fine tuning of the LSTM model, to ensure the prediction accuracy and minimize the consumption of communication and computing resources. A real-world dataset is developed from the KITTI datasets for simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed trajectory prediction scheme can maintain a prediction accuracy for safe platooning and reduce the delay of updating the neural networks by up to 40%.",

The diffusion o f new technologies, including low-cost sensors and devices, has introduced many possibilities and strategies to monitor environments, including Historical and Cultural value buildings. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, modern devices and sensors can collect and manage helpful information to build a Digital Twin of the surrounding environment. In this scenario, reproducing a Digital Twin of Cultural Heritage Buildings could be crucial to monitoring, managing, and performing action aiming to protect them.

A case study related to the Archeological Park of Pompeii will be presented, where real-time collected data is managed and shared via a web-cloud-IoT platform.

                "abstract": "The main claim of the Industry 4.0 manifesto (I4.0) is the promise of a significant transformation of production and delivery processes due to the digitization of manufacturing. A mandatory requirement of the I4.0 transition is the pervasive adoption of Information Technologies (IT), such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), and Big Data, starting with business management departments down to production sites. Despite IT has reached a consistent maturity level, its integration with Operation Technology (OT) is still a mostly unresolved challenge. In this article, we propose the design of a platform that supports reliable data gathering and sharing among OT and IT layers of an industrial manufacturing company, while also putting the basis for straightforward integration of business stakeholders in the data sharing loop. By leveraging widely used open-source tools, we implemented a software prototype of the platform that Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) can use to face the IT/OT convergence challenge in an affordable way. Results collected from an extensive assessment in real manufacturing settings show that the proposed solution allows meeting both functional and non-functional requirements of a typical data gathering/sharing process in a near-real-time scenario, by granting reliability with very low overhead cost.",

At the same time, the inherent safety and privacy risks associated with drone-based applications call for appropriate testing and monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.",

Learning dynamic net-work behaviors at the flow granularity is a core element for realizing DTN with accurate network modelling.

In this paper, we devise a Packet-Action Sequence Model to represent all possible packets behaviors in a unified way. Besides, we propose a novel and effective algorithm to assess whether the behavior pattern is time dependent or independent by using the temporal characteristics of packets in a network flow, so as to learn the key factors of packets that contribute to network behaviors. Based on two typical scenarios, i.e., packet caching and routing, the experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can identify network behavior patterns and learn key factors affecting the behaviors with over 99 &#x0025; accuracy.",

                "abstract": "The emergence of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DTENs) achieves the mapping of real physical entities to digital models of cyberspace. By offloading real-time mobile data to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers for processing and modeling, communication-efficient Digital Twin (DT) services could be achieved. However, the spatio-temporal dynamic DT service demand stochastically generated by mobile users easily causes service congestion, which challenges the long-term DT service stability. Meanwhile, current DT services still lack long-term effective incentive designs for participants. To solve these issues, we design an incentive-based congestion control scheme for stochastic demand response in DTENs. First, we adopt the Lyapunov optimization theory to decompose the long-term congestion control decision into a sequence of online edge association decisions, with no need for future system information. We then present a contract-based incentive design to optimize the long-term profit of the DT service provider, comprehensively considering the delay sensitivity, incentive compatibility, and individual rationality. Finally, experimental simulations are carried out to verify the superiority of the proposed scheme with the base station dataset of Shanghai Telecom. Theoretical and simulation analysis demonstrates that compared with benchmarks, our scheme could effectively avoid long-term service congestion with an arbitrarily near-optimal profit.",

The first-of-a-kind twin collects information about the computer network, associates it with attack tactics, measures the efficiency of implemented security controls requirements and automatically detects missing security controls. The twin also evaluates a cyber risk value using the attack graph and proposes prioritization of the detected requirements to rapidly reduce risk within existing system constraints. The cyber digital twin simulator offers several new risk reduction methods for automatically selecting security controls requirements. The necessary data for constructing a contextual cyber digital twin is defined, including the relationship between security controls and attack tactics.

Multiple virtual controllers and virtual edge computing nodes are constructed on a set of SD-EIC hardware platform to realize the integrated deployment of the real-time control for terminal devices and the AI model reasoning of product defect recognition algorithm based on machine vision respectively. In addition, the management and control scheme of product quality inspection system based on industrial information model is proposed. By constructing the semantic based digital twin information model of terminal device, the flexible adjustment and parameter configuration of terminal device are realized to meet the demands of flexible production and manufacturing.

It provides a flexible, modular, and scalable implementation to ensure large-scale, city-wide experimentation with a moderate computational cost. The defining feature of our Digital Twin is a unique architecture allowing for submission of sequential queries, to which the Digital Twin provides instantaneous responses with the \"state of the world\", and hence is an Oracle.

Gotham is used to build an IoT scenario composed of 100 emulated devices communicating via MQTT, CoAP and RTSP protocols, among others, in a topology composed of 30 switches and 10 routers. The scenario presents three threat actors, including the entire Mirai botnet lifecycle and additional red-teaming tools performing DoS, scanning, and attacks targeting IoT protocols. The testbed has many purposes, including a cyber range, testing security solutions, and capturing network and application data to generate datasets.

We envision a smart community (SC) as an inter-connected ecosystem ranging from a small region to a global scale enabled by IoT devices and key technologies for the betterment of its citizens, businesses, and organizations. A critical aspect for enabling such future smart communities is developing a secure and privacy-preserving access control (AC) framework to defend against malicious actors in the system. Traditionally, access control principles have been formulated based on the access control requirements of an enterprise, an application or a system. Smart communities are an evolving and dynamic concept that includes a range of interdisciplinary components. Thus it is appropriate to reevaluate current access control principles for such a diverse and dynamic ecosystem. In this paper, we first discuss access control requirements and then present access control principles for future smart communities. We envision a convergent access control approach towards enabling future smart communities where different access control models synergistically converge at both policy and enforcement layers. Therefore, we propose a Convergent Access Control (CAC) framework that can address the access control requirements of dynamic application domains such as in future smart communities.

                "abstract": "Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) is a networking architecture that can provide centralized control for vehicular networks. However, the design for routing policies in SDVNs is generally influenced by several limitations, such as frequent topological changes, complex service requests, and long model training time. Intelligent Digital Twin-based Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (IDT-SDVN) can overcome these weaknesses and maximize the advantages of the conventional SDVN architecture by enabling the controller to construct virtual network spaces and provide virtual instances of corresponding physical objects within the Digital Twin (DT). In this paper, we propose a junction-based hierarchical routing scheme in IDT-SDVN, namely, int<underline>el</underline>ligent d<underline>i</underline>gital <underline>t</underline>win hi<underline>e</underline>rarchical (ELITE) routing. The proposed scheme is conducted in four phases: policy training and generation in the virtual network, and deployment and relay selection in physical networks. First, the policy learning phase employs several parallel agents in DT networks and derives multiple single-target policies. Second, the generation phase combines the learned policies and generates new policies based on complex communication requirements. Third, the deployment phase selects the most suitable generated policy according to the real-time network status and message types. A road path is calculated by the controller based on the selected policy and then sent to the requester vehicle. Finally, the relay selection phase is utilized to determine relay vehicles in a hop-by-hop process along the selected path. Simulation results demonstrate that ELITE achieves substantial improvements in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and communication overhead compared with its counterparts.",

However, it is challenging to collect network traces in the real world because of high time and labor cost, weather limitations as well as safety concerns. In this work we attempt to tackle this challenge by designing a multi-fidelity simulator taking wireless Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks into consideration. We design the simulator by interfacing two Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) simulators we have developed in prior years: UBSim and UB-ANC. The former focuses on UAV network optimization and policy training by considering explicitly the network environments such as blockage dynamics, while the latter focuses more on high-fidelity UAV flight control. We first develop a coordination interface referred to as SimSocket for signaling exchanges between UBSim and UB-ANC in simulations, and then showcase coordinated simulations based on UBSim and UB-ANC. The new research that can be enabled by the integrated simulator is also discussed for digital twin-based UAS systems.",

Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior. In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations.

These latter need high-level protection against cyberattacks, which can lead to potential disastrous consequences (e.g., components sabotage, Denial of Service, human deaths). Thus, these infrastructures, before being deployed in mission, need intensive security testing and validation. Moreover, cybersecurity research is required to anticipate future attacks. The research of new countermeasures has to be led on realistic platforms for getting precise and fruitful feedback for cyberdefense. This paper describes an Industrial Control System testbed for Naval Defense cybersecurity research. This realistic testbed implements a representative model of a warship, on which practical attacks and related countermeasures can be safely benchmarked. After describing the features of our physical testbed, we illustrate its relevance by describing four different attack scenarios. This testbed will be very useful in future works to elaborate and validate innovative cyberdefense measures (like knowledge-based and behavior-based intrusion detection) against network and physical process attacks, especially by generating representative datasets.",

While the results of an assessment on a testbed may be more authentic than those carried out using simulation, conducting such experiments is fraught with challenges such as the time required to set up and launch attacks thus limiting the variety and number of attacks launched. To overcome such limitations, while maintaining the reliability of the outcome of the assessment, an approach based on timed automata models of a critical infrastructure was investigated. The investigation involved development of a digital twin for a 6-stage water treatment plant. A design-centric anomaly detection method, as well as an attack launcher, were integrated with the model and experiments were performed.

However, more connectivity and openness raise cyber security and safety concerns. Indeed, services that depend on online connectivity can serve as entry points for attacks on different assets of the vehicle. This study explores collaborative ways of selecting response techniques to counter real-time cyber attacks on automotive systems. The aim is to mitigate the attacks more quickly than a single vehicle would be able to do, and increase the survivability chances of the collaborating vehicles. To achieve that, the design science research methodology is employed. As a result, we present RIPOSTE, a framework for collaborative real-time evaluation and selection of suitable response techniques when an attack is in progress. We evaluate the framework from a safety perspective by conducting a qualitative study involving domain experts. The proposed framework is deemed slightly unsafe, and insights into how to improve the overall safety of the framework are provided.",

Despite numerous advantages, low computing resources at IoT devices and high communication costs for exchanging model parameters make applications of FL in massive IoT networks very limited. In this work, we develop a novel compression scheme for FL, called <italic>high-compression federated learning (HCFL)</italic>, for very large scale IoT networks. HCFL can reduce the data load for FL processes without changing their structure and hyperparameters. In this way, we not only can significantly reduce communication costs, but also make intensive learning processes more adaptable on low-computing resource IoT devices. Furthermore, we investigate a relationship between the number of IoT devices and the convergence level of the FL model and thereby better assess the quality of the FL process. We demonstrate our HCFL scheme in both simulations and mathematical analyses. Our proposed theoretical research can be used as a minimum level of satisfaction, proving that the FL process can achieve good performance when a determined configuration is met. Therefore, we show that HCFL is applicable in any FL-integrated networks with numerous IoT devices.",

Their use in applications such as augmenting the infrastructure of IoT facilities and test beds, monitoring and calibrating the operation of physical sensors, and developing Digital Twins of physical systems have led virtual sensors to attract research attention. Machine learning provides methods for modelling patterns in complex and big data generated by IoT sensing devices, allowing to model the behaviour of these devices. In this work, we investigate ML methods as means of implementation for virtual sensors. In particular, we evaluate the performance of six ML methods in terms of their effectiveness, accuracy and precision in generating sensory data based on data from physical sensors. In our study, we use a multi-modal dataset comprising IoT sensory data for temperature, humidity and illumination collected over a period of two years in an office space at University of Geneva. Our results show that the best performing model at predicting an output of a missing sensor is the Random Forest method, achieving MAPE error below 3%, 5% and 18% respectively for temperature, humidity and illuminance. The worst performing models were the linear radial basis function neural network and linear regression. In future research, we plan to deploy the best performing models natively on IoT devices, making use of tinyML and extreme edge computing methods.",

                "abstract": "Modern public and private infrastructure is increasingly large and complex regardless of the industry within which it is deployed - communications, power, transportation, manufacturing, finance, etc. Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADSs) analogous to living systems with autonomous and decentralized subsystems have been developed to support the requirements of modern infrastructure. Large-scale infrastructure is increasingly a significant source of data on both its own operations as well as the society dependent on it. Big data from infrastructure can thus supply a variety of artificial and augmented intelligence systems. Large complex infrastructures typically require large complex organizations to operate and maintain. Such organizations though are typically centralized and constrained by bureaucratic policies and procedures. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are emerging that may provide better transparency, autonomy and decentralization for the manner in which these large-scale infrastructures are operated. The paper contrasts DAOs and ADSs before identifying the requirements for DAO administration of an ADS.",

CS predictions have an audience of millions of readers, compared to the thousands who read traditional technical papers. This is partially because of the new content delivery models, but it is also due to the lighter weight and shorter format. Scorecards get even more attention: the audience wants to see how we did so that they can either cheer us on or criticize the prediction. Either way, it appears that predictions are here to stay. In the past, we largely delivered technology predictions via carefully orchestrated social media and press releases. This is the first time CS is using this publication to feature its predictions.",

Metaverse has a bright future and is expected to have many applications in various scenarios. The support of the Metaverse is based on numerous related technologies becoming mature. Hence, there is no doubt that the security risks of the development of the Metaverse may be more prominent and more complex. We present some Metaverse-related technologies and some potential security and privacy issues in the Metaverse. We present current solutions for Metaverse security and privacy derived from these technologies. In addition, we also raise some unresolved questions about the potential Metaverse. To summarize, this survey provides an in-depth review of the security and privacy issues raised by key technologies in Metaverse applications. We hope that this survey will provide insightful research directions and prospects for the Metaverse's development, particularly in terms of security and privacy protection in the Metaverse.",

They will inevitably promote technological innovation in the field of building information modeling (BIM) in the future. BIM organizes various building information into a whole by establishing a virtual three-dimensional model of architectural engineering using digital technology. The metaverse seamlessly integrates the real world and the virtual world, and conducts rich activities such as creation, display, and trading. Therefore, through the exploration of the metaverse, it will be possible to build an exciting digital world and transform the physical world better. Meanwhile, introducing the blockchain technology could ensure the fairness and security of resource transactions, data storage, and other activities. In this survey, we delve into the metaverse and blockchain empowerment by studying BIM components, metaverse applications in virtual world construction, and the latest research on blockchain. We also discuss how BIM technology and blockchain can be integrated with metaverse. The collaborations between academia and industry would be certainly required for further development and interdisciplinary research on the metaverse and the integration of blockchain into BIM. We hope to see our survey help researchers, engineers and educators build an open, fair and rational future BIM ecosystem.",

In this paper, we present FaultFlow, a newborn tool enabling a Model-Driven Engineering approach for supporting specification, analysis, and simulation of failure logic in component-based systems. The tool exploits a meta-model combining the representation of system configuration hierarchies together with a decoupled representation of its stochastically-timed failure logic. FaultFlow is available in a as-a-service mode through a Web Application deployed on the cloud as well as in a standalone mode, featuring a well-crafted Java API enabling effective specification of the system hierarchy as well as of intra-component fault-to-failure and inter-component failure-to-fault propagation models, respectively starting from SysML Block Definition Diagrams and stochastic Fault Trees representations. The automated transformation towards Stochastic Time Petri Nets enables integration with external reliability tools for quantitative evaluation through numerical solution or simulation. We illustrate FaultFlow key benefits by experimenting the approach on a case study contextualised in an Internet of Things scenario modelling a Pollution Monitor System within a Smart City.",

                "abstract": "On top of subscription-based pricing models such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), monetizing the subscription enables the payment of data streams with data usage instead of a particular price for a fixed data set. This pricing model allows data providers to have a better vision of managing budgets and data consumers to have the flexibility to subscribe and unsubscribe. However, unlike static data collections, the streaming data increases difficulties of dynamic data ownership and identity verification. A trustless data trading infrastructure is required where the entities can trade, validate data ownership and data integrity without trusting any service or participants. In addition, an automated subscription procedure is also demanded for the sake of data monetization. In this paper, we leverage usages of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to construct a decentralized data trading platform on top of the IoT brokered infrastructure. This approach can efficiently enhance the degree of transparency and scalability. The storage built upon cryptographic message protocols allows transmitting, accessing and validating data streams over distributed ledgers without authorities, and the digital rights of trading participants deserve a guarantee, which is enabled by design.",

                "abstract": "Virtualized collaboration can significantly increase remote management of critical infrastructures. Crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic push the technology: they require remote management to keep our infrastructures running. Mixed Reality (MR) prototypes enable remote management in diverse fields such as medicine, industry 4.0, energy systems, education, or cyber awareness. However, the evolution of virtualized collaboration is still in the beginning. By design, MR is fake: its reality is generated from models. This makes detecting attacks very difficult. Many MR-attacks result from well-known cybersecurity threats. This paper identifies classic attack surfaces, vectors, and concrete threats that are relevant for MR. It presents mitigation methods that can help to secure the underlying data exchanges. However, distributed systems are often heterogeneous and under different management authorities, making securing the entire virtualized remote management stack difficult. The paper therefore also introduces considerations towards an MR-client-based attack detection, i.e., MR-forensics, including relevant features and the use of machine learning.",

                "abstract": "The agriculture sector has seen growing applications of AI and data intensive systems. Typically, individual farm owners join together to form agricultural cooperatives to share resources, data, and domain knowledge. These data intensive cooperatives help generate AI supported insights for member farmers. However, this leads to a rising concern among individual smart farm owners about the privacy of their data, especially while sharing the data with the co-op. In this paper, we present a framework where the individual smart farm owner&#x0027;s privacy is preserved, as it is shared to train robust anomaly detection models at the cooperative level. Here, we preserve the privacy of each farm owner by adding noise to their data through data perturbation techniques such as white Gaussian noise. Our experimental results show that the anomaly detection models can identify various anomalous events even when the training data is transformed with white noise. Further, we evaluate our framework and compare the detection performance on non-transformed and transformed data that belongs to multiple smart farms present in a cooperative.",

                "abstract": "The omnipresence of smart devices in many aspects of modern everyday life has helped to achieve an enormous level of automation, has ensured sustainable development, and improved quality of life. Over the last decade, such small and portable devices became cheap and easy to deploy in any kind of application. With the full range of versatile connectivity, such technological development also brings multiple challenges related to the security of infrastructure and data. Many individuals, companies, and states worldwide experience the previously unseen scale and scope of the attacks using novel approaches. All these smart applications have also increased the overall attack surface leading to multiple attack vectors available through vulnerabilities. Lack of standards, insufficient security awareness, and new technological landscape does not help either. Considering this, one needs to enhance forensics investigation methodologies, employ novel tools, combine threat intelligence, and integrate forensic readiness. Such measures will help to reduce the total cyber risk through a high level of preparedness for anticipated data-driven crimes in smart applications. We believe that this paper will help in bringing novel focus to existing digital forensics methodologies with a focus on smart applications.",

The rapid evolution of the current threat landscape has seen many organisations share CTI to strengthen their security posture for mutual benefit. However, in many cases, CTI data contains attributes (e.g., software versions) that have the potential to leak sensitive information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI sharing framework that allows organisations to share sensitive CTI data in a trusted, verifiable and differential manner. We discuss the limitations associated with existing approaches and highlight the advantages of the proposed CTI sharing framework.

This new venture will require professionals in both software engineering and services computing to collaborate with an unprecedented intensity, and jointly develop the new interdisciplinary field hereby named Software Services Engineering (SSE). In SSE, the ever-deepening system dynamics emerging from both environments and humans in varying contexts are imposing steep challenges to both researchers and practitioners. Humans, both developers and the vast number of end users, are embedded ever closer to IoT environments, and are being afforded ample opportunities to continuously inject inputs during system development and after deployment. In fact, humans are increasingly playing the roles of both sensor and actuator. Traditional requirements engineering researchers are being lured more than ever into exploiting the IoT environments where human users are deeply embedded, to gather contextual information that inevitably introduces lots of ambiguity and uncertainty. Provisioning of highly adaptable and scalable microservices would be key to timely meeting ever-changing human desires and ever-evolving system requirements in the nimblest manner. As such, an ultra-agile and field-programmable development methodology and environment will be imperative to achieving such ultrafine grained microservices provisioning. Such ultra-agility and ultrafine granularity requirements imposed to the services industry obligate company executives to expect extreme manageability assurance to become the centroid of system operations and administration. The ultimate goal in pursuit of such a noble dream will be to provide genuinely individualized and trustworthy service, possibly enabled by AI, but it should be both explainable and ethical. Facing such grand challenges, this declaration samples a subset of burning issues in SSE through observations in seven themes, only meant to be starting points for the SSE community to further investigate. Through our declarations we also call for heightened attention to an assorted array of existing, barely emerging or non-existent services computing and software engineering methods for a concerted effort to research and explore.",

                "abstract": "The Graph-Massivizer project, funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program, researches and develops a high-performance, scalable, and sustainable platform for information processing and reasoning based on the massive graph (MG) representation of extreme data. It delivers a toolkit of five open-source software tools and FAIR graph datasets covering the sustainable lifecycle of processing extreme data as MGs. The tools focus on holistic usability (from extreme data ingestion and MG creation), automated intelligence (through analytics and reasoning), performance modelling, and environmental sustainability tradeoffs, supported by credible data-driven evidence across the computing continuum. The automated operation uses the emerging serverless computing paradigm for efficiency and event responsiveness. Thus, it supports experienced and novice stakeholders from a broad group of large and small organisations to capitalise on extreme data through MG programming and processing. Graph-Massivizer validates its innovation on four complementary use cases considering their extreme data properties and coverage of the three sustainability pillars (economy, society, and environment): sustainable green finance, global environment protection foresight, green AI for the sustainable automotive industry, and data centre digital twin for exascale computing. Graph-Massivizer promises 70&#x0025; more efficient analytics than AliGraph, and 30 &#x0025; improved energy awareness for extract, transform and load storage operations than Amazon Redshift. Furthermore, it aims to demonstrate a possible two-fold improvement in data centre energy efficiency and over 25 &#x0025; lower greenhouse gas emissions for basic graph operations.",

Agile Security models different types of security requirements into the context of an attack graph, containing business process targets and critical assets identification, configuration items, and possible impacts of cyber-attacks. By simulating and analyzing virtual adversary attack paths toward cardinal assets, Agile Security examines the business impact on business processes and prioritizes surgical requirements. Thus, handling these requirements backlog that are constantly evaluated as an outcome of employing Agile Security, gradually increases system hardening, reduces business risks and informs the IT service desk or Security Operation Center what remediation action to perform next.

A typical method to utilize these data is to train a machine learning algorithm to extract the features. Federated learning (FL) is a platform for a coalition of clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing their data to preserve data privacy. Data and model poisoning attacks, free-riding attacks, and model divergence due to clients&#x0027; non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets are some challenges in conventional federated learning. The lack of an evaluation method in federated averaging (FedAvg) in FL makes it impossible to identify malicious users or amend the divergence of the global model. In this study, we propose a Shapley-based aggregation algorithm called Shapley averaging (ShapAvg) to aggregate the global model more effectively by evaluating the clients&#x0027; models.

                "abstract": "The combination of big data and machine learning brings more convenience to people, but also brings security risks of data privacy leakage. The services provided by traditional machine learning can no longer meet the needs of privacy protection. The emergence of federated learning technology has alleviated privacy disclosure threats, however adversaries can still infer from the data model or even reconstruct the raw training data, causing the data privacy of the raw training data to be leaked. To solve this problem, we propose a secure federated learning mechanism based on variational autoencoder (VAE) to resist inference attacks. Participants use raw data to generate forged data through a VAE and train a local model with forged data, thereby protecting the data privacy and guaranteeing the quality of the global model. The experimental results show that the proposed secure federated learning mechanism can guarantee the high accuracy of the global model while reducing the probability of the raw data of the participants being reconstructed.",

Complicating matters was the difficulty, early this year, trying to forecast the movement of the Coronavirus and its likely effect on COMPSAC's attendance in a “real” environment. In April, our Standing Committee decided to take a very conservative approach and go virtual again rather than opt for an in-person, or even a hybrid version of the conference.

                "abstract": "Intelligent task placement and management of tasks in large-scale fog platforms is challenging due to the highly volatile nature of modern workload applications and sensitive user requirements of low energy consumption and response time. Container orchestration platforms have emerged to alleviate this problem with prior art either using heuristics to quickly reach scheduling decisions or AI driven methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary approaches to adapt to dynamic scenarios. The former often fail to quickly adapt in highly dynamic environments, whereas the latter have run-times that are slow enough to negatively impact response time. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling policies that are both reactive to work efficiently in volatile environments and have low scheduling overheads. To achieve this, we propose a Gradient Based Optimization Strategy using Back-propagation of gradients with respect to Input (GOBI). Further, we leverage the accuracy of predictive digital-twin models and simulation capabilities by developing a Coupled Simulation and Container Orchestration Framework (COSCO). Using this, we create a hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Co-simulation and the back-propagation approaches allow these methods to adapt quickly in volatile environments. Experiments conducted using real-world data on fog applications using the GOBI and GOBI* methods, show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time, Service Level Objective and scheduling time by up to 15, 40, 4, and 82 percent respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

Experiments conducted using real-world data on fog applications using the GOBI and GOBI* methods, show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time, Service Level Objective and scheduling time by up to 15, 40, 4, and 82 percent respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

This platform is based on IEC61131-3 programming standard that used to replace traditional Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). As is known to all, PLC has been playing an important role during the years of industrial automation revolution, we call it the Third Industrial Revolution. But the limited computing power of this device is not able to support artificial intelligence well, which cannot support deep learning algorithms. While different variations and implementations of controllers have been created over the last decade, ICICOS focuses on virtualization technology of industrial automation. It brings many benefits, including: the standardized electrical programming language brings a lot of users; the backup redundancy of virtual technology enhances the stability of the system; the concentration of computing power makes it competent for reasoning and learning of artificial intelligence.",

                "abstract": "Threat modeling is an analysis activity aimed at eliciting viable and realistic security and privacy threats in the design of a software-intensive system. Threat modeling allows for a by-design approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later costly development efforts. However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages. In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy technologies. This will enable systems to autonomously respond to emerging threats by dynamically activating dedicated controls or via run-time reconfiguration.",

However, the progress and promotion of Blockchain have been seriously impeded by various security issues in blockchain-based applications. Furthermore, previous research on blockchain security has been mostly technical, overlooking considerable business, organizational, and operational issues. To address this research gap from the perspective of information systems, we review blockchain security research in three levels, namely, the process level, the data level, and the infrastructure level, which we refer to as the PDI model of blockchain security. In this survey, we examine the state of blockchain security in the literature. Based on the insights obtained from this initial analysis, we then suggest future directions of research in blockchain security, shedding light on urgent business and industrial concerns in related computing disciplines.",

In the face of complex attack means and severe internal and external threats, it is difficult to achieve 100&#x0025; protection against information systems. It is necessary to enhance the continuous service of information systems based on network resiliency and take appropriate compensation measures in case of protection failure, to ensure that the mission can still be achieved under attack. This paper combs the definition, cycle, and state of cyber resilience, and interprets the cyber resiliency engineering framework, to better understand cyber resilience. In addition, we also discuss the evolution of security architecture and analyze the impact of cyber resiliency on security architecture. Finally, the strategies and schemes of enhancing cyber resilience represented by zero trust and endogenous security are discussed.",

These features enable the creation of intelligent mechanisms for decision support to overcome the limits of human knowledge processing. In addition, ML algorithms enable applications to draw conclusions and make predictions based on existing data without human supervision, leading to quick, near-optimal solutions even in problems with high dimensionality. Hence, autonomy is a key aspect of current and future AI/ML algorithms. This chapter focuses on the development and implementation of AI/ML technologies for 5G and future networks. The objective is to illustrate how these technologies can be smoothly migrated into 5G systems to increase their performance and to decrease their cost. To that end, this chapter presents the Drivers, Needs, Challenges, Enablers, and Potential Solutions identified for the AI/ML field as applicable to future networks over three-, five-, and ten-year horizons. AI/ML applications for 5G are wide and diverse. In this document, some of the key areas are described which includes networking, securing, cloud computing and others. Over time, this white paper will evolve to encompass even more areas where AI/ML technologies can improve future network performance objectives.",

                "abstract": "The detection of optic disc and macula is an essential step for ROP (Retinopathy of prematurity) zone segmentation and disease diagnosis. This paper aims to enhance deep learning-based object detection with domain-specific morphological rules. Based on the fundus morphology, we define five morphological rules, i.e., number restriction (maximum number of optic disc and macula is one), size restriction (e.g., optic disc width: 1.05 &#x002B;&#x002F;- 0.13 mm), distance restriction (distance between the optic disc and macula&#x002F;fovea: 4.4 &#x002B;&#x002F;- 0.4 mm), angle&#x002F;slope restriction (optic disc and macula should roughly be positioned in the same horizontal line), position restriction (In OD, the macula is on the left side of the optic disc; vice versa for OS). A case study on 2953 infant fundus images (with 2935 optic disc instances and 2892 macula instances) proves the effectiveness of the proposed method. Without the morphological rules, na&#x00EF;ve object detection accuracies of optic disc and macula are 0.955 and 0.719, respectively. With the proposed method, false-positive ROIs (region of interest) are further ruled out, and the accuracy of the macula is raised to 0.811. The IoU (intersection over union) and RCE (relative center error) metrics are also improved.",

We propose to leverage massive twinning, which 6G is envisaged to support, to reduce the data traffic in EI and therewith enhance its performance.",

                "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities are constantly detected in software, and with CVE a world wide infrastructure exists to inform about such vulnerabilities. Typically, the software vendor issues a patch for the vulnerability. The system owners have to install patches timely in order protect against attacks that exploit vulnerabilities. In industrial automation &#x0026; control systems, there is often a lot of overhead for installing patches, as availability must be ensured. Hence it makes sense to patch immediately only if the vulnerability poses a high risk to the operation of the plant. We propose an algorithm for calculating the system-specific risk of a vulnerability, based on a system model and a system risk image for system-specific exposure and impact. The system-specific exposure depends on the deployment, while the level of impact depends on the purpose of the system, e.g. in critical infrastructure.",

                "titleHighlight": null,
                "abstract": "Multi-clouds are becoming central to large and modern applications including those in business, industry and critical infrastructure sectors. Designers usually deploy these clouds hierarchically to get the best advantage of low latency of the edge clouds and high processing capabilities of the core clouds. The data that flows into the clouds for processing and storage and moves out to other system domains for further use must cross multiple trust boundaries, and as a result, face large attack surfaces. This gives malicious actors abundant opportunity to penetrate and potentially harm organizations or bring down critical services causing widespread disruptions and mayhem. Deep neural network models can be used in innovative ways to protect the confidentiality and integrity of dataflows in the clouds. However, the use of deep learning comes with some challenges. In large multi-location and multi-cloud environments, deep learning models grow rapidly in size and complexity, inhibiting fast training of cloud models and making it difficult to maintain accuracy of detection of known and unknown attacks on the data-in-motion. This impedes their use in critical infrastructure services. We propose innovative distributed-hierarchical-merged models, which make use of cooperative training at the edge and the core clouds, and the power of data and model parallelisms, to achieve rapid training with high accuracy. Our broad objectives in this paper are twofold: Firstly, we show that merged hierarchical deep learning models, working cooperatively in the multi-cloud, significantly reduce the parameters to be trained and results in faster core cloud training time. Secondly, training the merged core model with distribute strategy for data parallelism on CPUs and GPUs further reduces the training time significantly. We also show that while achieving improvement by about 25&#x0025; over unmerged models and the accuracy of detection of unknown attacks in the range 96.9-99.5&#x0025;.",

The decentralized technical architecture of blockchain provides new ideas for solving these problems. However, it faces challenges in computing resource consumption and data segmentation between on-chain and off-chain. This paper proposes a blockchain-based information management system that can reliably manage data related to vehicles. The system adopts a sharding blockchain structure, which means IoV nodes in a limited area form a sub-chain to increase the calculation speed and reduce the burden on the main-chain. Besides, an on-chain and off-chain computing scheme based on trusted execution environment is proposed to solve data source credibility and computing resource consumption of smart contract. A case which is the driving data management in vehicle insurance scenarios is studied and implemented as an example of application of the system proposed. Experiments show that the resource and time consumption of the smart contract designed is acceptable.",

                "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) brings computational resources to the edge of network that triggers the paradigm shift of centralized machine learning towards federated learning. Federated learning enables edge nodes to collaboratively train a shared prediction model without sharing data. In MEC, heterogeneous edge nodes may join or leave the training phase during the federated learning process, resulting in slow convergence of dynamic communities and federated learning. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained training strategy for federated learning to accelerate its convergence rate in MEC with dynamic community. Based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, the proposed scheme enables each edge node to adaptively adjust its training strategy (aggregation timing and frequency) according to the network dynamics, while compromising with each other to improve the convergence of federated learning. To further adapt to the dynamic community in MEC, we propose a meta-learning-based scheme where new nodes can learn from other nodes and quickly perform scene migration to further accelerate the convergence of federated learning. Numerical results show that the proposed framework outperforms the benchmarks in terms of convergence speed, learning accuracy, and resource consumption.",

                "abstract": "With the increased digitization in the manufacturing sector, cognitive computing entails great potential to improve services and production. This is also referred to as cognitive manufacturing. The general idea is to simulate human cognitive processes - with the aim to improve decision making - by using machine learning (ML) to leverage the increased amount of data. However, the seamless adoption of cognitive computing and ML techniques to industrial automation systems on all abstraction levels is currently impeded by different challenges. Prominent blocking points are the heterogeneity of the systems, which impedes uniform data access and ML integration, and the lack of support for managing various ML life cycle phases. In this work, we propose a framework to manage data and ML life cycles in industrial automation systems. The framework comprises an architecture for the flexible integration of ML components (from component to cloud level) and their adaptive management (including retraining and updates). We address three phases of ML explicitly: pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment. We present first results and experiences of applying the framework to an industrial use case and discuss its future potential towards enabling cognitive manufacturing.",

To be effective in quality and efficient in productivity, they require a strong toolchain with seamless automation. The DevOps approach can help reach this by unifying software development and operations with a strong focus on automation and monitoring. The aim of this short paper is to review automation tasks that are specific to a model-driven context and to classify them according to a typical DevOps lifecycle covering design, code, testing, deployment and runtime activities. Tasks are identified based on different industry use cases experienced in our research centre or reported in the literature. Some challenges are identified and discussed, especially related to the use of bots in a model-driven context.",

We consider embedded systems such as single board computers and industrial controllers. While prior literature considers side channel based anomaly detection, this study addresses the following central question: is anomaly detection feasible when using low-fidelity simulated data without using data from a known-good (golden) system? To study this question, we use data from a simulator-based proxy as a stand-in for unavailable golden data from a known-good system. Using data generated from the simulator, one-class classifier machine learning models are applied to detect discrepancies against expected side channel signal patterns and their inter-relationships. Side channels fused for Trojan detection include multi-modal <italic>side channel</italic> measurement data (such as Hardware Performance Counters, processor load, temperature, and power consumption). Additionally, fuzzing is introduced to increase detectability of Trojans. To experimentally evaluate the approach, we generate low-fidelity data using a simulator implemented with a component-based model and an information bottleneck based on Gaussian stochastic models. We consider example Trojans and show that fuzzing-aided golden-free Trojan detection is feasible using simulated data as a baseline.",

This requires that a metaverse offers a real-time virtual representation of the physical world with its entities, relationships, events, states, processes, and activities. According to the Gartner forecast report, the metaverse is among the top five emerging trends and technologies. Gartner predicts that by 2026 25% of people will spend at least one hour every day in the metaverse and 30% of organizations will have products and services developed for metaverse platforms.2 The metaverse is in an early developmental stage but has a considerable promise of occupying prominent space in the next phase of the Internet.",

Continual learning (CL) is a viable solution to this problem, which aims to train a model to learn a series of tasks without forgetting old knowledge. Currently, there is no work to investigate the problem of CL in a cross-edge FL scenario. In this paper, we propose <italic>Cross-FCL</italic>, a <italic>Cross</italic>-edge <italic>F</italic>ederated <italic>C</italic>ontinual <italic>L</italic>earning framework. Specifically, it enables devices to retain the knowledge learned in the past when participating in new task training through a parameter decomposition based FCL model. Then various cross-edge strategies are introduced, including biased global aggregation and local optimization, to trade off memory and adaptation. We conducted experiments on a real-world dataset and other public datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cross-FCL achieves best accuracy on IID and highly non-IID tasks with a low storage cost compared to other baselines.",

                "abstract": "While the recent boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to the technology's use and popularity across many domains, the same boom has exposed vulnerabilities of the technology to many threats that could cause the next \"AI winter\". AI is no stranger to \"winters\", or drops in funding and interest in the technology and its applications. Many in the field consider the early 1970's as the first AI winter with another proceeding in the late 1990's and early 2000's. There is some consensus that another AI winter is all but inevitable in some shape or form, however, current thoughts on the next winter do not consider secure and robust AI and the implications of the success or failure of these areas. The emergence of AI as an operational technology introduces potential vulnerabilities to AI's longevity. The National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI) report outlines recommendations for building secure and robust AI, particularly in government and Department of Defense (DoD) applications. However, are they enough to help us fully secure AI systems and prevent the next \"AI winter\"? An approaching \"AI Winter\" would have a tremendous impact in DoD systems as well as those of our adversaries. Understanding and analyzing the potential of this event would better prepare us for such an outcome as well as help us understand the tools needed to counter and prevent this \"winter\" by securing and robustifying our AI systems. In this paper, we introduce the following four pillars of AI assurance, that if implemented, will help us to avoid the next AI winter: security, fairness, trust, and resilience.",

                "abstract": "The rapid development and wide application of blockchain not only highlight the significance of privacy protection (including anonymity and confidentiality) but also the necessity of auditability. While several ingenious schemes such as MiniLedger and traceable Monero supporting both privacy protection and auditability have been proposed, they either provide incomplete privacy protection (only achieving anonymity within a small set or only providing confidentiality but not anonymity), or involve additional auditing conditions such as reaching threshold transaction volume or requiring permissioned nodes to serve as the manager, or restrict to specific blockchain types such as Monero. To mitigate these issues, this article proposes a generic anonymous, confidential, and auditable transaction system (named ACA), which is compatible with both UTXO-based permissionless and permissioned blockchains. Core technologies of ACA include designed traceable anonymous key generation and publicly verifiable authorization mechanisms from existing cryptographic tools (i.e., public key encryption, partially homomorphic encryption, and accumulator) as well as the meticulous designed signatures of knowledge and smart contract. To demonstrate the entity of our proposal, we first prove its security including authenticity, anonymity, confidentiality and soundness, and then provide an instantiation to evaluate its performance. The final implementation and benchmarks show that our proposal can still gain performance advantage even adding more functionalities.",

In this paper, we study the efficient provisioning and management of compute resources in the Edge-to-Cloud continuum for different types of real-time applications with timeliness requirements depending on application-level update rates and communication/compute delays. We begin by introducing a highly stylized network model allowing us to study the salient features of this problem including its sensitivity to compute vs. communication costs, application requirements, and traffic load variability. We then propose an online decentralized service placement algorithm, based on estimating network delays and adapting application update rates, which achieves high service availability. Our results exhibit how placement can be optimized and how a load-balancing strategy can achieve near-optimal service availability in large networks.",

                "abstract": "Recent ransomware attacks (e.g., Colonial and JBS) caused significant social and economic impact due to their ability to shut down entire businesses. A functional model divides next-generation malware (NG-malware) attacks into 3 stages: Penetration (to gain a foothold), Propagation (to gain full control of target system), and a variety of Exploitation methods. The functional model shows that many attack methods and tools can be flexibly combined to bypass implementation-specific defenses at each stage, with the most important defense battleground being the prevention of NG-malware gaining full control of target system. Given the potential for further evolution of MG-malware, e.g., obfuscation of lateral movement jobs to increase both the speed and stealth of Propagation, it is crucial for the defense to develop effective defenses to detect NG-malware Propagation before ceding full control. An experimental platform that enables detailed evaluation of new NG-malware attacks and defenses is an effective tool in the battle for full control.",

                "abstract": "Air free cooling is an energy-efficient cooling scheme that has been adopted in the dry and cold climate zones. To adopt this cooling scheme in Singapore&#x0027;s tropical condition, we designed and implemented an air free-cooled DC testbed integrating sensing and control systems for the server and room conditions. Then, we conducted extensive experiments on the testbed to understand its energy efficiency and server reliability. This paper presents the key observations, experiences, and learned lessons obtained from our testbed over a duration of nearly two years. The experiments show that (1) the air free-cooling design can achieve the power usage effectiveness of 1.05, (2) the tropics&#x2019; year-round high temperatures up to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">Z_$37^\\circ$_Z</tex-math></inline-formula>C do not impede the air free-cooling, and (3) the implementation of the air free-cooled tropical DCs requires special cares to deal with airborne contaminants to avoid fast corrosion rate and dust-induced server faults. Based on our experiment data, a set of recommendations on the temperature control and the selection of IT equipment for air free-cooled tropical DCs is made. The descriptions of the learned lessons, the resulting recommendations, and the released data can be useful to the relevant research communities, governmental agencies, and standardizing bodies.",

                "abstract": "Although AI is transforming the world, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.

However, microservice systems are also suffering from the presence of a substantial number of potentially vulnerable components that may threaten the protection of critical infrastructures. To address the problem, this paper proposes to leverage the concept of antifragility built in a framework for building self-learning microservice systems that could be strengthened by faults and threats instead of being deteriorated by them. To illustrate the approach, we instantiate the proposed approach of autonomous machine learning through an experimental evaluation on a benchmarking dataset of microservice faults.",

                "abstract": "In the last years, Cyber Ranges have become a widespread solution to train professionals for responding to cyber-threats and attacks. Cloud computing plays a key role in this context since it enables the creation of virtual infrastructures on which Cyber Ranges are based. However, the setup and management of Cyber Ranges are expensive and time-consuming activities. In this paper, we highlight the novel features for the next-generation Cyber Range platforms. In particular, these features include the creation of a virtual clone for an actual corporate infrastructure, relieving the security managers from the setup of the training scenarios and sessions, the automatic monitoring of the activities of the participants, and the emulation of their behavior.",

                "abstract": "With the continuous development of web technology, Web3.0 has attracted a considerable amount of attention due to its unique decentralized characteristics. The digital economy is an important driver of high-quality economic development and is currently in a rapid development stage. In the digital economy scenario, the centralized nature of the Internet and other characteristics usually bring about security issues such as infringement and privacy leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how to use Web3.0 technologies to solve the pain points encountered in the development of the digital economy by fully exploring the critical technologies of digital economy and Web3.0. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of Web3.0 that should be integrated with the digital economy to better find the entry point to solve the problems by examining the latest advances of Web3.0 in machine learning, finance, and data management. We hope this research will inspire those who are involved in both academia and industry, and finally help to build a favourable ecology for the digital economy.",

Even a simple application interacting with a human user consists of software building blocks, a service delivery, various hardware systems, user experience, energy management, connectivity and many more. Systems engineering or \"systems thinking,\" as it is often called, ensures that products deliver more value than the capabilities of their individual parts. Such value beyond the individual components is what we call a system, or even a system of systems. A system is a set of interacting elements that together achieve a purpose.",

This system is based on 2D animation, and uses C # language to output 3D graphics. First, it analyzes and researches the 3D model, structure and contents contained in each part. Secondly, related concepts and basic principles are described in theory, and then the process and methods of interactive virtual simulation generated based on artificial intelligence algorithm are introduced. Finally, corresponding interactive DM 3D art visual effect systems are designed for different types of data sources, and the model is tested. The test results show that the time for data acquisition, image preprocessing and parameter calculation of the model is about 5s.",

Existing NAG momentum-based FL algorithms depend on either worker momentum only or aggregator momentum only, which may be inefficient due to infrequent usage of momentum, data heterogeneity, and out-of-date momentum. FastSlowMo combines the advantages of worker momentum and aggregator momentum to address these issues. We then provide mathematical proof for the convergence of FastSlowMo. Finally, extensive experiments based on real-world datasets and trace-driven simulation are conducted, verifying that FastSlowMo decreases the total training time by 3&#x2013;61&#x0025;, and outperforms existing mainstream benchmarks under a wide range of settings.",

                "abstract": "At present, the concept of metaverse has sparked widespread attention from the public to major industries. With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.",

Digital transformation projects are therefore in a unique position to realize the sustainable development agenda.Sustainability is a major social concern of our times and has been addressed extensively in the IS literature. Current discussions on sustainability are mainly following the United Nations report, focusing on goals around energy consumption, carbon footprint reduction and the like. We believe that a broad discussion on two fronts is needed: (1) ensuring that the development and use of information systems is in line with sustainability objectives, and (2) ensuring that th organization doesn&#x2019;t falls back to the old &#x2018;steady state&#x2019; after transformation initiatives are completed. The first contribution of this paper is a holistic definition of sustainable digital transformation, based on an literature research. The second contribution is the development of a fractal sustainable object model and an exploration into the impact of this model on enterprise modeling in two small cases. The first case is about environmental accounting, the second on the enterprise engineering method. We consider this paper to be a first in a series. The focus is on developing the overall framework with some &#x2018;light weight&#x2019; validation. A full verification and implementation is left for future research.",

                "abstract": "Southbound message delivery from the control plane to the data plane is one of the essential issues in multi-tenant clouds. A natural method of southbound message delivery is that the control plane directly communicates with compute nodes in the data plane. However, due to the large number of compute nodes, this method may result in massive control overhead. The Message Queue (MQ) model can solve this challenge by aggregating and distributing messages to queues. Existing MQ-based solutions often perform message aggregation based on the physical network topology, which do not align with the fundamental requirements of southbound message delivery, leading to high message redundancy on compute nodes. To address this issue, we design and implement VITA, the first-of-its-kind work on virtual network topology-aware southbound message delivery. However, it is intractable to optimally deliver southbound messages according to the virtual attributes of messages. Thus, we design two algorithms, submodular-based approximation algorithm and simulated annealing-based algorithm, to solve different scenarios of the problem. Both experiment and simulation results show that VITA can reduce the total traffic amount of redundant messages by 45&#x0025;-75&#x0025; and reduce the control overhead by 33&#x0025;-80&#x0025; compared with state-of-the-art solutions.",
